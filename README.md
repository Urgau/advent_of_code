# Advent of Code

My solution for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!
